subtitle: Are you looking for an apartment? Do you want to find a partner according to your tastes and requirements? RooMatch turns the concept of house hunting upside down. This application allows you to search both for an apartment and for a roommate. And not only that, it allows you to find and meet your ideal roommate.

if you have found your apartment, but can't afford it on your own and are looking for people to share it with, you can do it! Create your ad and this way the experience of living away from home will be perfect, or at least how and with whom you want.
With RooMatch you won't go through what you have heard so many times from acquaintances who have shared an apartment: "I don't like my partner" "I hardly know my partner, he is like a ghost, I never see him" "My partner is a disaster" ... You decide who to live with and who not. You will have a chat to contact your future partners and ask what's on your mind.
We also have a MATCH, which is the percentage of compatibility that appears below each user to guide you on their character and the possible connection and similarity between your personalities taking into account what you have put in your profile.

The big news with respect to the other apps is that the tenant himself can find others in his same situation and thus search for a house/apartment together. In other words, you can look for empty apartments and join together to fill them with people, and thus form your home.

* Important notice regarding permits. In order to function optimally RooMatch has to have access to the following service:

- Depending on the cell phone and model (some don't need it), it is advisable to activate and allow notifications in the RooMatch app, all this in your mobile settings, to facilitate communication between you!
